Dots per inch (DPI)  
In typography, the size of type is measured in units called points. One point equals 1/72 of an inch.
physical inches are not a useful measure, because there is no fixed relation between physical inches and pixels. Instead, fonts are measured in logical units. A 72-point font is defined to be one logical inch tall. Logical inches are then converted to pixels. or many years, Windows used the following conversion: One logical inch equals 96 pixels.
12 points = 12/72 logical inch = 1/6 logical inch = 96/6 pixels = 16 pixels
This scaling factor is described as 96 dots per inch (DPI).

The following illustration shows a 72-point font. The solid lines show a 1" tall bounding box around the text. The dashed line is called the baseline. Most of the characters in a font rest on the baseline. The height of the font includes the portion above the baseline (the ascent) and the portion below the baseline (the descent). In the font shown here, the ascent is 56 points and the descent is 16 points.
